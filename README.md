Working legally as a white hat hacker while complying with the General Data Protection Regulation #GDPR #DSGVO #RODO and the proposed #AIAct requires careful consideration of several factors:

- Always obtain explicit written permission from the organization before conducting any security testing or analysis.

- Minimize personal data access and processing during your work.

- If you must handle personal data, ensure you have a legal basis for processing under GDPR Article 6.

- Implement appropriate security measures to protect any data you access.

- Be prepared to assist with data subject rights requests if your activities involve personal data.

- If your white hat hacking involves AI systems, be aware of the AI Act's risk categories and requirements.

- For high-risk AI systems, ensure compliance with transparency, human oversight, and documentation requirements.

- Ensure all reporting complies with GDPR principles, especially data minimization.

- Sign appropriate non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) before beginning work.

- Respect the confidentiality of the organization's data and systems.

- Consider obtaining relevant certifications (e.g., Certified Ethical Hacker, CISSP) to demonstrate your expertise and commitment to ethical practices.

- Familiarize yourself with relevant national and EU laws regarding cybersecurity and hacking.

- Consider working with a legal professional to ensure your contracts and practices are compliant.

- Follow agreed-upon protocols for reporting vulnerabilities.

- Allow organizations reasonable time to address issues before any public disclosure.

- Stay updated on evolving regulations, especially as the AI Act is still in development.

- Regularly review and update your practices to ensure ongoing compliance.

- Consider professional liability insurance to protect yourself in case of unintended consequences of your work.
